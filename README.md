🖱️ DontSleep - Prevent Your PC from Going Idle
DontSleep is a lightweight utility that prevents your computer from going to sleep or appearing idle in applications like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Zoom. It works by subtly moving the mouse cursor back and forth at a defined interval.

🔹 Features
✔️ Moves the mouse by 1 pixel back and forth
✔️ Prevents system sleep, screen lock, and idle status
✔️ User-defined time interval for movement
✔️ Runs silently in the background
✔️ No installation required – just run the EXE

🚀 How to Use
Download DontSleep.exe
Run the executable (no installation needed)
Adjust the movement interval and click Start
Click Stop when you no longer need it
⚠️ Note
If the .exe is blocked, right-click it, go to Properties, and check Unblock.
If needed, download the .zip version.
